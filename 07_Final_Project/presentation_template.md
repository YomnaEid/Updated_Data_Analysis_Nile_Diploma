## Presentation Tips

### Design Best Practices
- Use a consistent, professional design template
- Limit text (aim for no more than 6 bullet points per slide, 6 words per bullet)
- Choose appropriate visualization types for your data
- Use a consistent color scheme aligned with your data categories
- Ensure all text is readable from a distance (minimum 24pt font)
- Include your name and slide numbers in the footer

### Delivery Guidance
- Time your presentation to fit within the 5-minute limit
- Practice your delivery multiple times
- Prepare to explain technical concepts in accessible language
- Focus on insights and business impact, not technical details
- Be prepared to answer questions about your methodology and findings
- Have backup slides for anticipated questions

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Overwhelming slides with too much text or complex visuals
- Using jargon without explanation
- Showing tables with too many rows or columns
- Including visualizations without clear labels or context
- Running significantly over or under time
- Focusing on methods rather than insights

Remember that your presentation should tell a coherent story about your data and findings. Lead your audience from the problem, through your analysis process, to your conclusions and recommendations in a logical, compelling way.
