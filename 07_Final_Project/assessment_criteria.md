### 3. Analysis & Insights (25%)

| Criteria | Excellent (A) | Good (B) | Satisfactory (C) | Needs Improvement (D) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Technical Analysis | Sophisticated analysis with appropriate techniques | Solid analysis using suitable methods | Basic analysis completed | Limited or flawed analysis |
| Statistical Rigor | Proper statistical methods with validation | Appropriate statistical approach | Basic statistics applied | Incorrect or missing statistics |
| Depth of Insights | Profound insights that reveal non-obvious patterns | Meaningful insights derived from data | Basic insights identified | Few or trivial insights |
| Critical Thinking | Exceptional evaluation of limitations and alternatives | Good discussion of limitations | Basic acknowledgment of limitations | Limited critical assessment |

### 4. Visualization & Communication (20%)

| Criteria | Excellent (A) | Good (B) | Satisfactory (C) | Needs Improvement (D) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Visualization Quality | Professional, publication-quality visualizations | Clear, effective visualizations | Basic but functional visualizations | Poor or misleading visualizations |
| Dashboard Design | Intuitive, cohesive dashboard with excellent UX | Well-designed, functional dashboard | Basic interactive elements | Limited interactivity or poor design |
| Storytelling | Compelling narrative that effectively communicates findings | Clear story with logical flow | Basic presentation of findings | Disjointed or unclear narrative |
| Accessibility | Excellent explanation of complex concepts for non-technical audience | Good balance of technical and accessible content | Some effort to explain technical concepts | Overly technical or jargon-heavy |

### 5. Technical Implementation (15%)

| Criteria | Excellent (A) | Good (B) | Satisfactory (C) | Needs Improvement (D) |
|----------|---------------|----------|------------------|------------------------|
| Code Quality | Exceptionally clean, efficient, well-documented code | Well-structured, readable code | Functional code with basic documentation | Poorly organized or undocumented code |
| Tool Selection | Optimal tool selection with clear justification | Appropriate tools for the task | Basic tools that accomplish the task | Inappropriate or inefficient tools |
| Reproducibility | Fully reproducible analysis with clear instructions | Mostly reproducible with documentation | Partially reproducible | Not reproducible |
| Technical Proficiency | Advanced use of multiple techniques and libraries | Competent use of appropriate techniques | Basic application of techniques | Limited technical capabilities |
