- F11 to instantly create a chart
- Quick Analysis tool (CTRL+Q) for instant visualizations

### Programming with Python

**What you would see in a live demo:**

In a Python demonstration, you would see the instructor using a Jupyter Notebook, showing how code and output appear together in an interactive document. Key elements would include:

1. **Importing libraries**: Loading pandas, matplotlib, and other essential packages
2. **Loading data**: Reading CSV files into DataFrame structures
3. **Data exploration**: Viewing and summarizing data
4. **Data manipulation**: Filtering, grouping, and transforming data
5. **Visualization**: Creating plots to understand patterns
6. **Analysis insights**: Interpreting the results

**Example code snippet for basic data analysis:**

```python
# Import libraries
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Load data
sales_data = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')

# View the first few rows
print(sales_data.head())

# Get summary statistics
print(sales_data.describe())

# Group data by region and product
region_product_sales = sales_data.groupby(['Region', 'Product'])['Sales'].sum().reset_index()

# Create a visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
sns.barplot(x='Region', y='Sales', hue='Product', data=region_product_sales)
plt.title('Sales by Region and Product')
plt.xticks(rotation=45)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()

# Find top-selling products
top_products = sales_data.groupby('Product')['Sales'].sum().sort_values(descending=True)
print("Top 5 Products:")
print(top_products.head(5))
```

![Python Jupyter Interface](image/lesson5/python_interface.png)

**Key Python data analysis concepts:**

3. **Filtering**: Using WHERE clauses to find specific records
4. **Joining tables**: Combining data from multiple sources
5. **Aggregation**: Summarizing data with GROUP BY
6. **Result viewing**: How results are displayed in tabular format

**Example SQL queries:**

```sql
-- Basic query to retrieve all sales data
SELECT * FROM sales_data LIMIT 10;

-- Filtering for a specific region
SELECT * FROM sales_data WHERE region = 'Northeast';

-- Joining sales data with product information
SELECT s.date, s.region, p.product_name, s.units_sold, s.revenue
FROM sales_data s
JOIN products p ON s.product_id = p.id;

-- Aggregating sales by region
SELECT region, SUM(revenue) as total_revenue
FROM sales_data
GROUP BY region
ORDER BY total_revenue DESC;
```
