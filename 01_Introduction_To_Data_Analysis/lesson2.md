## 2. üóÇÔ∏è Structured vs. Unstructured Data

![Data Structure Types](image/lesson2/data_structure_types.png)

### Structured Data

Structured data is organized in a predefined format, making it easily searchable and analyzable.

#### üìã Key Characteristics:

- Follows a strict, predefined model
- Organized in rows and columns
- Easy to search and analyze with standard tools
- Typically stored in relational databases

**Examples:**

- Excel spreadsheets
- SQL databases
- CSV files
- Survey results with fixed responses
- Financial records

**Real-world data examples:**
```
Customer database entry:
ID: 10458
Name: Ahmed Hassan
Email: ahmed.h@example.com
Age: 34
Registration Date: 2024-11-12
Subscription Type: Premium
Monthly Spend: $29.99

Sales transaction table:
TransactionID | Date       | ProductID | Quantity | UnitPrice | CustomerID
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
T-45892      | 2025-04-22 | PRD-112   | 3        | $24.99    | 10458
T-45893      | 2025-04-22 | PRD-087   | 1        | $49.99    | 10458
T-45894      | 2025-04-22 | PRD-254   | 2        | $12.50    | 10782
```

### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data lacks a predefined data model and doesn't fit neatly into traditional databases.

#### üåê Key Characteristics:

- No predefined organization or format
- Difficult to search with conventional tools
- Requires specialized processing techniques
- Contains rich and complex information

**Examples:**

- Email messages
- Social media posts
- Video and audio recordings
- Images and photographs
- Open-ended survey responses

**Real-world data examples:**
```
Social media post:
"Just experienced the most amazing customer service at @TechCompany! The representative spent 45 minutes helping me troubleshoot my device issues and even followed up the next day to make sure everything was working properly! #CustomerServiceWin #HappyCustomer"

Customer support email:
Subject: Issues with recent order #45892
Body: "Hello, I ordered three t-shirts on April 22nd but received only two. The missing shirt is the blue one in size medium. Could you please look into this? Also, the packaging was damaged upon arrival. I've attached photos of the box. Thanks for your help."
```

### Semi-Structured Data

A hybrid category that contains elements of both structured and unstructured data.

#### üîÑ Key Characteristics:

- Has some organizational properties but doesn't conform to strict formats
- Contains tags or markers that separate elements
- More flexible than structured data but more organized than unstructured

**Examples:**

- JSON files
- XML documents
- HTML webpages
- Email headers combined with message body

**Real-world data examples:**
```
JSON product data:
{
  "product_id": "PRD-112",
  "name": "Premium Cotton T-Shirt",
  "price": 24.99,
  "available_colors": ["Black", "White", "Navy", "Red"],
  "available_sizes": ["S", "M", "L", "XL"],

      "user_id": "U10782",
      "rating": 4,

## üìã Homework

### ‚úçÔ∏è Assignment Tasks

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Find three real-world datasets - one primarily quantitative, one primarily qualitative, and one that contains both types of data**

- For each dataset, identify the source type, structure, and any potential ethical considerations

**2Ô∏è‚É£ For each dataset, document:**

- The source (primary or secondary)
- The structure (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured)
- Any potential ethical considerations when using this data

### üí™ Challenge Exercise (Optional)

Select a business or organization you're familiar with and create a data inventory. List 5-10 types of data they likely collect, and classify each according to the categories we've discussed today. For each data type, briefly note any ethical or privacy considerations that should be addressed.

**Tip:** Consider starting with obvious data types like customer information, then think about less obvious data such as website analytics or employee performance metrics.
