### Quantitative Data

**Key Characteristics:**

- 🔢 Numerical in nature
- 📈 Can be used for statistical analysis
- 📐 Objective measurement
- 🧮 Mathematical operations can be performed on it

**Examples:**

- Age: 25 years
- Temperature: 72°F
- Income: $65,000/year
- Time: 45 minutes
- Score: 85/100

#### Subtypes of Quantitative Data

**📊 Discrete Data**

- Whole numbers/countable values
- Finite number of possible values
- Cannot be divided into smaller parts
- *Examples:* Number of students, children, cars

**📈 Continuous Data**

- Can take any value within a range
- Infinite number of possible values
- Can be divided into smaller parts
- *Examples:* Height, weight, temperature

### Qualitative Data

**Key Characteristics:**

- 📝 Descriptive rather than numerical
- 💬 Focuses on experiences, opinions, and attributes
- 🧠 Often subjective
- 🔍 Rich and detailed information

**Examples:**

- Gender: Male, Female, Non-binary
- Color preference: Blue
- Product feedback: "The interface is confusing"
- Mood: Happy, Sad, Anxious
- Category: Vegetable, Fruit, Grain

#### Subtypes of Qualitative Data

**🏷️ Nominal Data**

- Categories with no inherent order
- Cannot be ranked or compared meaningfully
- *Examples:* Blood types, eye colors, nationalities

**📋 Ordinal Data**

- Categories with a meaningful order/rank
- Differences between values may not be consistent
- *Examples:* Rating scales, education levels, rankings

> "Both data types are valuable, and many robust analyses combine qualitative and quantitative approaches."

## 2. 🗂️ Structured vs. Unstructured Data

![Data Structure Types](image/lesson2/data_structure_types.png)

### Structured Data

Structured data is organized in a predefined format, making it easily searchable and analyzable.

#### 📋 Key Characteristics:

- Follows a strict, predefined model
- Organized in rows and columns
- Easy to search and analyze with standard tools
- Typically stored in relational databases

**Examples:**

- Excel spreadsheets
- SQL databases
- CSV files
- Survey results with fixed responses
- Financial records

### Unstructured Data

Unstructured data lacks a predefined data model and doesn't fit neatly into traditional databases.

#### 🌐 Key Characteristics:

- No predefined organization or format
- Difficult to search with conventional tools
- Requires specialized processing techniques
- Contains rich and complex information

**Examples:**

- Email messages
- Social media posts
- Video and audio recordings
- Images and photographs
- Open-ended survey responses

### Semi-Structured Data

A hybrid category that contains elements of both structured and unstructured data.

#### 🔄 Key Characteristics:

- Has some organizational properties but doesn't conform to strict formats
- Contains tags or markers that separate elements
- More flexible than structured data but more organized than unstructured

**Examples:**

- JSON files
- XML documents
- HTML webpages
- Email headers combined with message body

## 📝 Activity: Classifying Data Types

### Group Exercise (20 minutes)

#### 💬 Instructions

1. Form groups of 3-4
2. For each example below, classify the data as:
   - Qualitative or Quantitative
   - If Quantitative: Discrete or Continuous
   - If Qualitative: Nominal or Ordinal
   - Structured or Unstructured
3. Identify a potential primary and secondary source for each type of data

#### Examples to Classify:

1. Customer satisfaction ratings (1-5 stars)
2. Employee email communications
3. Annual revenue figures for a company

## 📋 Homework

### ✍️ Assignment Tasks

**1️⃣ Find three real-world datasets - one primarily quantitative, one primarily qualitative, and one that contains both types of data**

- For each dataset, identify the source type, structure, and any potential ethical considerations

**2️⃣ For each dataset, document:**

- The source (primary or secondary)
- The structure (structured, semi-structured, or unstructured)
- Any potential ethical considerations when using this data

### 💪 Challenge Exercise (Optional)

Select a business or organization you're familiar with and create a data inventory. List 5-10 types of data they likely collect, and classify each according to the categories we've discussed today. For each data type, briefly note any ethical or privacy considerations that should be addressed.

**Tip:** Consider starting with obvious data types like customer information, then think about less obvious data such as website analytics or employee performance metrics.
