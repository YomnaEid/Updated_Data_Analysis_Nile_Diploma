### Detailed Skill Breakdown

#### 1. Technical Skills Deep Dive

##### üîç SQL & Database Knowledge

SQL (Structured Query Language) is the foundation for most data analyst roles, allowing analysts to extract, transform, and manipulate data from relational databases.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Writing complex queries using joins, subqueries, and window functions
- Aggregating and summarizing data efficiently
- Understanding database schema design and relationships
- Optimizing query performance

**Example SQL Query:**

```sql
SELECT
  department,
  COUNT(employee_id) as employee_count,
  AVG(salary) as avg_salary,
  SUM(sales) as total_sales
FROM employees
JOIN sales ON employees.id = sales.employee_id
WHERE hire_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31'
GROUP BY department
HAVING COUNT(employee_id) > 5
ORDER BY total_sales DESC;
```

##### üìä Data Visualization

The ability to transform complex data into intuitive visual representations that communicate insights clearly to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Selecting appropriate visualization types for different data and questions
- Designing clear, accessible charts and graphs
- Creating interactive dashboards for exploration
- Applying visual best practices (color, layout, annotation)

**Common Visualization Types:**

- **Bar Charts**: Best for comparing categories
- **Line Charts**: Best for trends over time
- **Scatter Plots**: Best for relationships between variables

##### üíª Programming (Python/R)

Programming skills expand an analyst's toolkit beyond spreadsheets and BI tools, enabling automation, advanced statistics, and custom analysis.

**Key Capabilities:**

- Data manipulation with libraries like Pandas (Python) or dplyr (R)
- Creating reproducible analyses and reports
- Applying statistical methods and machine learning algorithms
- Automating repetitive tasks and workflows

**Example Python Code:**

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load and clean data
df = pd.read_csv('sales_data.csv')
df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'])
df = df.dropna(subset=['amount'])

# Aggregate by month
monthly_sales = df.resample('M', on='date')['amount'].sum()

# Visualization
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
monthly_sales.plot(kind='line')
plt.title('Monthly Sales Trends')
plt.ylabel('Total Sales ($)')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

#### 2. Soft Skills Deep Dive

**Critical Thinking Framework:**

1. **Ask:** What question are we trying to answer? Why is it important?
2. **Acquire:** What data do we need? Where can we find it?
3. **Analyze:** What does the data show? What methods should we apply?
4. **Assess:** How confident are we in the results? What are the limitations?
5. **Act:** What actions should be taken based on this analysis?
