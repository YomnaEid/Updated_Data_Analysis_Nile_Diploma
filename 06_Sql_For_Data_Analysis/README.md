## Getting Started

Each module contains:
- Lecture materials (in Markdown format)
- Sample SQL files to follow along
- Exercises with clear instructions
- Sample data in the `/data` directory
- Solutions in the `/solutions` directory

## Prerequisites

- Basic understanding of data concepts
- SQL database system installed (SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL)
- SQL client or interface

## Software Requirements

This course includes examples for SQLite, which is lightweight and requires no server setup. For more advanced examples, MySQL or PostgreSQL may be used.

## Data

The course uses these sample datasets stored in the `/data` directory:

1. **Northwind Database**: A sales database with customers, products, orders, and suppliers. Used for business operations and sales analysis examples.

2. **Sakila Database**: A movie rental database with films, customers, and rental information. Used for consumer behavior and inventory management examples.

3. **Chinook Database**: A digital media store database with tracks, invoices, and customer information. Used for digital product analysis examples.

4. **Employees Database**: An HR database with employee, department, and salary information. Used for organizational analysis examples.

Each database presents different analytical opportunities and challenges. Modules are designed to progress from simpler queries with Northwind to more complex analysis with all databases in the later modules.
