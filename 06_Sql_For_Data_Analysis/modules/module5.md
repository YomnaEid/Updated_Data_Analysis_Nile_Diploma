# Module 5: Data Analysis Case Studies

## 5.1 Business Metrics Analysis

Business metrics analysis involves using SQL to derive key performance indicators (KPIs) that measure business health and progress toward strategic goals.

### Revenue Analysis

```sql
-- Monthly revenue trend analysis
SELECT
  DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) AS month,
  SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS number_of_orders,
  COUNT(DISTINCT o.customer_id) AS number_of_customers,
  SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) / COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS average_order_value
FROM orders o
JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
WHERE o.order_date >= '2022-01-01' AND o.order_date < '2024-01-01'
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date)
ORDER BY month;

-- Year-over-year comparison
WITH monthly_sales AS (
  SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS monthly_revenue
  FROM orders o
  JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
  WHERE o.order_date >= '2022-01-01' AND o.order_date < '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date), EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date)
)
SELECT
  curr.year AS current_year,
  curr.month,
  curr.monthly_revenue AS current_revenue,
  prev.monthly_revenue AS previous_revenue,
  (curr.monthly_revenue - prev.monthly_revenue) / prev.monthly_revenue * 100 AS yoy_growth_percentage
FROM monthly_sales curr
LEFT JOIN monthly_sales prev ON
  curr.month = prev.month AND
  curr.year = prev.year + 1
WHERE curr.year = 2023
ORDER BY curr.month;
```

### Customer Acquisition Cost

```sql
-- Calculate Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
WITH marketing_costs AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', date) AS month,
    SUM(amount) AS total_marketing_spend
  FROM marketing_expenses
  WHERE date >= '2023-01-01' AND date < '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', date)
),
new_customers AS (
  SELECT
    DATE_TRUNC('month', first_order_date) AS month,
    COUNT(*) AS num_new_customers
  FROM (
    SELECT
      customer_id,
      MIN(order_date) AS first_order_date
    FROM orders
    GROUP BY customer_id
  ) first_orders
  WHERE first_order_date >= '2023-01-01' AND first_order_date < '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', first_order_date)
)
SELECT
  mc.month,
  mc.total_marketing_spend,
  nc.num_new_customers,
  CASE
    WHEN nc.num_new_customers > 0 THEN mc.total_marketing_spend / nc.num_new_customers
    ELSE NULL
  END AS customer_acquisition_cost
FROM marketing_costs mc
JOIN new_customers nc ON mc.month = nc.month
ORDER BY mc.month;
```

### Customer Lifetime Value

```sql
-- Calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)
WITH customer_orders AS (
  SELECT
    o.customer_id,
    MIN(o.order_date) AS first_order_date,
    MAX(o.order_date) AS last_order_date,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) AS num_orders,
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_spend
  FROM orders o
  JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
  GROUP BY o.customer_id
),
customer_metrics AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    first_order_date,
    last_order_date,
    num_orders,
    total_spend,
    total_spend / num_orders AS avg_order_value,
    (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (last_order_date - first_order_date)) / 86400) / 30 AS customer_age_months,
    CASE
      WHEN (EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (last_order_date - first_order_date)) / 86400) > 30
      THEN num_orders / ((EXTRACT(EPOCH FROM (last_order_date - first_order_date)) / 86400) / 30)
      ELSE num_orders
    END AS purchase_frequency_per_month
  FROM customer_orders
  WHERE num_orders > 1
)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  avg_order_value,
  purchase_frequency_per_month,
  avg_order_value * purchase_frequency_per_month * 24 AS estimated_two_year_value, -- 24 months
  total_spend,
  customer_age_months
FROM customer_metrics
ORDER BY estimated_two_year_value DESC;
```

## 5.2 Customer Behavior Analysis

Customer behavior analysis uses SQL to understand how customers interact with your business, their buying patterns, preferences, and loyalty.

### RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)

```sql
-- RFM Analysis
WITH customer_rfm AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    CURRENT_DATE - MAX(order_date) AS recency,

  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '2 years'
  GROUP BY customer_id
),
rfm_scores AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY recency DESC) AS recency_score,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY frequency) AS frequency_score,
    NTILE(5) OVER (ORDER BY monetary) AS monetary_score
  FROM customer_rfm
)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  recency_score,
  frequency_score,
  monetary_score,
  (recency_score + frequency_score + monetary_score) / 3 AS average_score,
  CASE
    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score >= 4 AND monetary_score >= 4 THEN 'Champions'
    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score >= 3 AND monetary_score >= 3 THEN 'Loyal Customers'

    WHEN recency_score >= 4 AND frequency_score <= 2 AND monetary_score <= 2 THEN 'New Customers'
    WHEN recency_score >= 3 AND frequency_score <= 2 AND monetary_score <= 2 THEN 'Promising'
    WHEN recency_score <= 2 AND frequency_score >= 3 AND monetary_score >= 3 THEN 'At Risk'
    WHEN recency_score <= 2 AND frequency_score >= 3 AND monetary_score <= 2 THEN 'Needs Attention'
    WHEN recency_score <= 2 AND frequency_score <= 2 AND monetary_score >= 3 THEN 'About to Sleep'
    WHEN recency_score <= 1 AND frequency_score <= 1 AND monetary_score <= 1 THEN 'Lost'
    ELSE 'Others'
  END AS customer_segment
FROM rfm_scores
ORDER BY average_score DESC;
```

### Cohort Analysis

```sql
-- Cohort Retention Analysis
WITH first_purchases AS (
  SELECT
    customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(order_date)) AS cohort_month
  FROM orders
  GROUP BY customer_id
),
customer_activity AS (
  SELECT
    o.customer_id,
    DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date) AS order_month,
    fp.cohort_month,
    (EXTRACT(YEAR FROM DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date)) -
     EXTRACT(YEAR FROM fp.cohort_month)) * 12 +
    (EXTRACT(MONTH FROM DATE_TRUNC('month', o.order_date)) -
     EXTRACT(MONTH FROM fp.cohort_month)) AS month_index
  FROM orders o
  JOIN first_purchases fp ON o.customer_id = fp.customer_id
  WHERE o.order_date >= '2022-01-01'
),
cohort_size AS (
  SELECT
    cohort_month,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS num_customers
  FROM first_purchases
  GROUP BY cohort_month
),
retention AS (
  SELECT
    cohort_month,
    month_index,
    COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS num_customers
  FROM customer_activity
  GROUP BY cohort_month, month_index
)
SELECT
  r.cohort_month,
  cs.num_customers AS cohort_size,
  r.month_index,
  r.num_customers,
  ROUND((r.num_customers * 100.0 / cs.num_customers), 2) AS retention_percentage
FROM retention r
JOIN cohort_size cs ON r.cohort_month = cs.cohort_month
ORDER BY r.cohort_month, r.month_index;
```

### Customer Journey Analysis

```sql

    o.customer_id,
    o.order_id,
    o.order_date,
    p.category,
    ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY o.customer_id ORDER BY o.order_date) AS journey_step
  FROM orders o
  JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
  JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id
)
SELECT
  customer_id,
  STRING_AGG(category, ' â†’ ' ORDER BY journey_step) AS category_path,
  COUNT(*) AS journey_length,
  MIN(order_date) AS journey_start_date,
  MAX(order_date) AS journey_last_date
FROM customer_journey
GROUP BY customer_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY journey_length DESC, customer_id;
```

### Purchase Funnel Analysis

```sql
-- Purchase funnel analysis
WITH funnel_stages AS (
  SELECT
    visitor_id,
    MAX(CASE WHEN event = 'page_view' AND page = 'product_listing' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS viewed_listing,
    MAX(CASE WHEN event = 'page_view' AND page = 'product_detail' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS viewed_product,

  ROUND((SUM(completed_purchase) * 100.0 / SUM(viewed_listing)), 2) AS overall_conversion_rate
FROM funnel_stages;
```

## 5.3 Time Series Analysis

Time series analysis involves analyzing and visualizing how data changes over time, identifying patterns, trends, and seasonality.

### Moving Averages and Trends

```sql
-- Calculate different moving averages for sales
WITH daily_sales AS (
  SELECT
    DATE(order_date) AS sale_date,
    SUM(amount) AS daily_revenue
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01' AND order_date < '2024-01-01'
  GROUP BY DATE(order_date)
)
SELECT
  sale_date,
  daily_revenue,
  AVG(daily_revenue) OVER(
    ORDER BY sale_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS seven_day_moving_avg,
  AVG(daily_revenue) OVER(
    ORDER BY sale_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 13 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS fourteen_day_moving_avg,
  AVG(daily_revenue) OVER(
    ORDER BY sale_date
    ROWS BETWEEN 29 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
  ) AS thirty_day_moving_avg
FROM daily_sales
ORDER BY sale_date;
```

  GROUP BY DATE(order_date)
)
SELECT
  EXTRACT(DOW FROM sale_date) AS day_of_week,
  TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Day') AS day_name,
  AVG(daily_revenue) AS avg_daily_revenue,
  COUNT(*) AS num_days,
  RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(daily_revenue) DESC) AS revenue_rank
FROM date_sales
GROUP BY EXTRACT(DOW FROM sale_date), TO_CHAR(sale_date, 'Day')
ORDER BY day_of_week;

SELECT
  EXTRACT(MONTH FROM order_date) AS month_num,
  TO_CHAR(order_date, 'Month') AS month_name,
  EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS year,
  SUM(amount) AS monthly_revenue,
  COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS order_count,
  COUNT(DISTINCT customer_id) AS customer_count,
  SUM(amount) / COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) AS avg_order_value
