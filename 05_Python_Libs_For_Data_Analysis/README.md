# Python Libraries for Data Analysis

## Overview
This module focuses on essential Python libraries specifically designed for data analysis and visualization. After learning Python basics in the previous module, you'll now discover how these powerful libraries can transform your data analysis capabilities.

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Manipulate numerical data efficiently using NumPy
- Process, clean, and analyze structured data with Pandas
- Create various types of data visualizations with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly
- Perform geographical data visualization
- Apply these libraries to real-world data analysis problems

## Prerequisites
- Completion of Module 4: Introduction to Python
- Python environment with Anaconda or standalone Python installation
- Basic understanding of data structures and programming concepts
